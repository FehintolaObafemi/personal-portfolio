Hello! I'm Taofeek, also known as Fehintola, a software engineer currently in Austin, TX.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, algorithms, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

After getting my [B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.morgan.edu/electrical-and-computer-engineering/undergraduate-program/bs-electrical-engineering), I decided to further my education by also obtainining a degree in both the [M.S in Advanced Computing](https://www.morgan.edu/computer-science/degrees-and-programs/ms_advancedcomputing) program and the [M.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering program](https://www.morgan.edu/school-of-engineering/academics/masters-programs/master-of-engineering) at Morgan State University. Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer for [Microsoft Corp](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), building [Writing Alley](https://writingalley.com/) and working on various pet projects on the side.
