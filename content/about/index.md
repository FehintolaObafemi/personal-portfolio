Hello! I'm Taofeek, also known as Fehintola, a software engineer currently in Baltimore, MD.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, algorithms, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

After getting my [B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www2.morgan.edu/soe/ece) at [Morgan State University](https://www.morgan.edu/), I decided to enroll in both the [M.S in Advanced Computing](https://www2.morgan.edu/cs/advcomputing) program and the [M.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering program](https://catalog.morgan.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=13&poid=2683&returnto=830) at Morgan State University. I am currently working with the Data Engineering and Predictive Analytics Research Lab - Morgan State University under the guidance of Dr. Kofi Nyarko and as an IBM Graduate Quantum Researcher under the guidance of [Dr. Paul Wang](https://p-neumann.github.io/paul/).
