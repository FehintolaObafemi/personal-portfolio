Hello! I'm Taofeek, also known as Fehintola, a software engineer currently in Baltimore, MD.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, algorithms, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

After getting my B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Morgan State University](https://www.morgan.edu/soe/ece), I decided to enroll in both the [M.S in Advanced Computing](https://www.morgan.edu/school_of_computer_mathematical_and_natural_sciences/departments_and_programs/computer_science/degrees_and_programs/ms_advancedcomputing.html) program and the [M.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering program](https://www.morgan.edu/school_of_engineering/departments/electrical_and_computer_engineering/graduate_program/masters_programs/master_of_engineering.html) at Morgan State University. I am currently working with the [Data Engineering and Predictive Analytics Research Lab - Morgan State University](https://www.morgan.edu/school_of_engineering/departments/electrical_and_computer_engineering/laboratory_and_research_facilities.html) under the guidance of [Dr. Kofi Nyarko](https://www.morgan.edu/research_and_economic_development/faculty_highlights/kofi_nyarko.html) and as an [IBM Graduate Quantum Researcher]() under the guidance of [Dr. Paul Wang](https://p-neumann.github.io/paul/).

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
