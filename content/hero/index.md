I'm a software engineer based in Baltimore, MD specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional websites, applications, writing concrete algorithms and everything in between. I also dabble in Quantum Computing, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. While not actively modifying or developing scripts and algorithms, I create digital art, play video games and listen to audio books.
